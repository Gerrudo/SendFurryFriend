# SendFurryFriend

This is the source code for a node.js app I host in Azure at: https://sendafurryfriend.azurewebsites.net

Here, you can input the URL of your discord webhook and it will post a picture of a cat randomly from the CatAPI(https://thecatapi.com/).

I will be reguarly updating the site to add new features around once a week. 

If you have any features or suggestions you'd like me to look at for this project please email me or feel free to fork and make your own improvements.

Thanks for checking out my repo!
